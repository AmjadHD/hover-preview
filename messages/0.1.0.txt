Hover Image Preview v0.1.0
===========================

## New Features

- images are detected in any location (not only between "", '' or ()) (#15, #31)
- you can now preview images with a keybinding, a mousbinding or from the context menu, for more details see the README (#24)
- you can now disable the preview on hover
- images with size less than 1KB are now expressed in Bytes
- support for urls with no protocol (e.g www.gettyimages.fr/gi-resources/images/Embed/new/embed2.jpg)

## Fixes

- .ico images are not rendered
- size of 0KB is shown for images with size less than 1KB

## Notes

- the "all_formats" settings is removed
- "formats_to_convert" don't start with dot "." anymore, if you've already overridden the setting you must remove leading dots
