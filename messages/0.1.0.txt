Hover Image Preview v0.1.0
===========================

## New Features
    - images are detected in any location (not only between "", '' or ()) (#15, #31)
    - you can now preview images with a keybinding, a mousbinding or from the context menu, for more details see the README (#24)
    - you can now disable the preview on hover
    - images with size less than 1KB are now expressed in Bytes
    - support for urls with no protocol (e.g www.gettyimages.fr/gi-resources/images/Embed/new/embed2.jpg)

## Fixes
    - .ico images are not rendered
    - size of OKB is shown for images with size less than 1KB

## Notes
    - the "all_formats" settings is deprecated
    - the "simple_formats" setting is added, it takes an array of image formats supported by sublime text popups (i.e don't need conversion)
